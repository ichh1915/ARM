## Work and contribution during the group phase 

Implemented DCD, DCB, FILL, EQU, END instructions which was not done in the individual phase. Due to the memory 

Added following global 
`flexOp2:Datapath->FlexOp2->uint32` | Calculate the flexible second operand as `uint32`
`Op2SetCFlag:Datapath->FlexOp2->bool option` |  Parse the `C flag` update status during the calculation of the flexible Op2
`checkCond:DataPath->Condition->bool` | Check whether the flags status match the condition during the conditional operation
