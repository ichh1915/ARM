## Work and contribution during the group phase 

* Implemented the parsing and execution of `DCD`, `DCB`, `FILL`, `EQU` and `END` instructions which was not done during the individual phase. Due to these instruction are excuted at the top level, it is done with help from team member Zheng yang Lee's work which includes `commonTop`.   

* Added following useful functions
    * `Op2SetCFlag:Datapath->FlexOp2->bool option` | Parse the `C flag` update status during the calculation of the flexible Op2
    * `checkCond:DataPath->Condition->bool` | Check whether the flags status match the condition during the conditional operation

* Updated parsing for `shift`, `bitwise logic`, `tst` and `mov` to fit the new interface. Added syntax error checking during * parsing.
